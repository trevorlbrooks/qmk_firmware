# Tradestation
QMK for Tradestation Macropad

This macropad was layout designed by Didier Luximon

This PCB supports an overall 4x4 matrix with unique spacing.
* Top two rows are 1U keys with 1/8U spacing
* Bottom two rows are available with 4x2 1U as clusters of 2x1U or as 2x2 2U, spaced with 1/4U

For QMK Configurator, the info.json is utilised.
- For 2U keys , the first 1u row/column key assignment is the same as the 2u position.

Build requires a pro micro.

Can be built as single PCB with custom case, or as two PCB style with standoffs.
